<h2> Installation </h2> 

You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. 
The following packages (libraries) need to be installed: <br>
import numpy as np <br>
import pandas as pd <br>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt <br>
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split <br>
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression <br>
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error <br>
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score <br>


You will need to download the Student Marks Dataset from Kaggle. You can find the data to download from the link  https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/student-marks-dataset

<h2> Project Motivation </h2> 
The goal is to Predict student's marks of students by their studying average time using linear regression and evaluation metric by R2 and to answer intersting question related to the dataset such as the min/max marks with their details such as time study and number of courses. 


<h2> File Description </h2> 

The data consists of Marks of students including their study time & number of courses. The dataset is downloaded from kaggle



<h2> Results </h2> 
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available at medium link 


<h2> Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements </h2>
Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the kaggle link
